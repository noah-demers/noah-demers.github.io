The Queue Simulator is a Java-based console application that models a simple queue system, such as a customer service line. It simulates the passage of time in discrete units, where at each time unit, a customer may randomly arrive and be added to the queue. Simultaneously, there's a probability that the next customer in line will be served and removed from the queue. The simulator tracks and prints out each customer's arrival time, queue size, and waiting time, giving a basic yet insightful view of queue behavior under random conditions. It's useful for understanding fundamental queue dynamics and service models.
