summary: "A gender predictor model that takes user input then predicts the gender for that user. As this is my first machine learning project dealing with user input as training data it is very crude project. I will be studying more machine learning and creating better projects in the future. "

The gender_predictor project is a machine learning notebook designed to classify a person’s gender based on their name, major, height, weight, and hobbies. It uses a dataset of that information labeled by gender and applies natural language processing techniques—such as extracting information to train a model capable of making predictions. The model is evaluated for accuracy and tested on sample data. This project demonstrates practical applications of supervised learning and text preprocessing, giving insight into feature engineering from string data. It's suitable for learning basics of classification using data like names, majors, height, weight, and hobbies.
