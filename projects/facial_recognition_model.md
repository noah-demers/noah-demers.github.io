This project implements a real-time facial recognition system using a webcam feed. It loads known facial encodings and compares them against live video input to detect and identify faces. The system utilizes libraries like face_recognition and OpenCV for handling image processing and face matching. Itâ€™s designed to annotate the video stream with bounding boxes and names of recognized individuals, making it suitable for basic surveillance, authentication, or personal use cases.
